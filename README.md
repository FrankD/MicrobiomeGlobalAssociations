# Detecting Global Microbiome Associations

This code uses the rstan interface to the Stan library to fit a hierarchical multi-task model for identifying global associations across the microbiome. This implements the method described in [Hatami et al. (2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.897538v2).

Documentation is in preparation.
